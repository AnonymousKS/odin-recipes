    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 quarts oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder,
        salt, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. Make a well in the center and
        pour in the milk, egg, butter, and vanilla. Mix until well blended.
        Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 370 degrees F (185
        degrees C). On a floured board, roll chilled dough out to 1/2 inch
        thickness. Use a 3 inch round cutter to cut out doughnuts. Use a smaller
        cutter to cut holes from center. If you do not have a small cutter, use
        the mouth of a bottle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry doughnuts in hot oil until golden brown, turning once. Remove from
        oil to drain on paper plates. Combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon
        cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar in a large resealable bag. Place a few warm
        donuts into the bag at a time, seal and shake to coat.
