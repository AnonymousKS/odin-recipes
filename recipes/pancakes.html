    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often
      thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs,
      milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying
      pan, often frying with oil or butter.
