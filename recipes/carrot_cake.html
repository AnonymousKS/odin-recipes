    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Carrot cake is cake that contains carrots mixed into the batter. Most
      modern carrot cake recipes have a white cream cheese frosting. Sometimes
      nuts such as walnuts or pecans are added into the cake batter, as well as
      spices such as cinnamon, ginger and ground mixed spice. Fruit including
      pineapple, raisins and shredded coconut can also be used to add a natural
      sweetness.
